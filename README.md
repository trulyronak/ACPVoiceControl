# ACP Voice Control

Since [the American College of Physicians](https://acponline.org/) has no accessibility settings for their online content, I am creating my own software to enable people with disabilities to use the site's content to study for exams. This is currently being developed specifically for [the MKSAP19 Test](https://mksap19.acponline.org).

If you know of a better solution or existing accessibility options for this, please email me immediately @ [ronak.manish.shah@gmail.com](mailto:ronak.manish.shah@gmail.com), as it would help tremendously.
